## Overview
Magento 2 API for Mobile App was built to decrease burden of the developers when developing a new mobile app, regardless of native apps or hybrid apps. Besides the main purpose of connecting Magento 2 websites to the apps, we can use this API to govern how Magento can interact with other third-party software.

## What is this for? 
With this API library, you can save lots of time when you want to develop a mobile app or PWA app for your Magento 2 website.
